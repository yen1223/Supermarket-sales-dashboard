# Supermarket sales Power BI Dashboard Creation Using Kaggle Data

## Introduction
This README provides a detailed walkthrough of creating a Power BI dashboard using the supermarket_sales dataset from Kaggle. The dashboard aims to analyze sales data from January to March 2019 across three cities in Vietnam, offering insights for promotion and category planning.

## Data Acquisition
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle, specifically the supermarket_sales dataset. This dataset contains 1,000 transactions, 17 columns with info on customer membership, gender, product line, branch, payment method and rating. 

### Steps:
1. Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle
2. Performed initial data cleaning in Microsoft Excel before importing into Power BI
### Created 4 tables with relationship and _data transformation_ before establishing relationship:
3. Opened Power Query Editor and created the first table, naming it _Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019_
   
4. Transformation in Table _Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019_:
    - Inserted an 'Average price' column by dividing 'Total' by 'Quantity' (despite having a 'Unit price' column)
    - Removed irrelevant columns such as 'cogs', 'gross margin percentage', 'gross income', and 'City'
    - Recoded the 'Customer type' column: replaced 'Member' with '1' and 'Normal' with '0'
    - Recoded the 'Gender' column: replaced 'Male' with '1' and 'Female' with '0'
    - Renamed the 'Product line' column to 'Category'
    - Created a composite 'MemberGender_Key' column from 'Customer type (code)' and 'Gender (code)' to serve as a foreign key for the "Customer type & gender" reference table
      
5. Loaded the same dataset and named table no.2 as _Branch>City_ as a reference table with only columns of 'Branch' and 'City'

6. Created another reference table, named _Customer type & gender_:
    - Started with 'Customer type (code)', 'Gender (code)' columns
    - Created a composite code column of 'MemberGender_Key' to serve as primary key
    - Added new columns of 'Gender' , 'Membership' 'Member&Gender' as description for coded columns

7. Created table, _Category Sales_:
    - Group by 'Total' (sales amount) by 'Product line'
    - Renamed the 'Total' column as 'Category Sales' , 'Product line' column as 'Category'
    - Enabled more detailed info on tooltip by having measure related to the level of category sales

8. Created table, _Calendar_ to define date hierarchies and allow time-based analysis:
    - Created a calendar table of Jan to March 2019
    - Inserted columns of 'Month','Month-Year','Day','Month(no)' as month number
  
9. Built one to many relationships among tables:
    - _Branch>City_ (Branch) 1-* _Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019_ (Branch)
    - _Customer type & gender_ (MemberGender_Key) 1-* _Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019_ (MemberGender_Key)
    - _Category Sales_ (Category) 1-* _Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019_ (Category)
    - _Calendar_ (Date) 1-* _Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019_ (Date)

### Data transformation after establishing one-to-many relationships: 
10. Created measures in table _Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019_


| MeasuresðŸ–©            | DAX                                                                | Presented as                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Average Sales Amount | `Average Sales Amount = AVERAGE('Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019'[Total])` | Metric in the form of<br>multi-row card |
| Jan sales            | `Jan sales = CALCULATE(sum('Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019'[Total]),'Calendar'[Month]="January")`| Monthly category sales in clustered column chart |
| Feb sales            | `Feb sales = CALCULATE(sum('Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019'[Total]),'Calendar'[Month]="February")`| Monthly category sales in clustered column chart |  
| March sales          | `March sales = CALCULATE(sum('Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019'[Total]),'Calendar'[Month]="March")`| Monthly category sales in clustered column chart |  
| Mar Sales Growth vs Feb | `Mar Sales Growth vs Feb = DIVIDE(([March sales]-[Feb sales]),[Feb sales])` | Metric in the form of multi-row card;<br>Tooltip on monthly category sales in clustered column chart|
| Mar Sales Growth vs Jan | `Mar Sales Growth vs Jan = DIVIDE(([March sales]-[Jan sales]),[Jan sales])` | Metric in the form of multi-row card;<br>Tooltip on monthly category sales in clustered column chart|
| String_for_cat_button | `String_for_cat_button = If(SELECTEDVALUE('Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019'[Category], 0) == 0, "See category details", "See details for " & SELECTEDVALUE('Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019'[Category]))` | Enable string shown on drill through button reflect the filtered value for category|
| String_for_city_button | `String_for_city_button = If(SELECTEDVALUE('Branch>City'[City], 0) == 0, "See branch details", "See details for " & SELECTEDVALUE('Branch>City'[City]))` | Enable string shown on drill through button reflect the filtered value for city|

12. Created 'Time (3 hours)' ,'Time (bins)' columns to be applied on clustered column chart to show sales over time
13. Created measures in table _Category Sales_

|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Branch contribution | `Branch contribution = sum('Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019'[Total])/sum('Category Sales'[Category Sales])` | Tooltip on top categories in clustered bar chart to show selected branch contribution to category sales|
| Category Sales Ranking (Jan-Mar) | `Category Sales Ranking (Jan-Mar) = rankx(ALLSELECTED('Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019'[Category]),CALCULATE(sum('Sales Jan 2019-Mar 2019'[Total])), ,DESC,Dense)` | Tooltip on monthly category sales in clustered column chart|

### Visualisation on summary page:
